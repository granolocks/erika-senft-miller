            The site-specific nature of my work seeks to encourage every participant—dancer, artist, performer, and viewer—to become an active collaborator that shapes the meaning and execution of the project. This website is no different. I’m inviting my collaborators, peers, and friends to contribute their varying perspectives of our work together to this site in the form of photos, videos, writing, and anything else you can dream.
