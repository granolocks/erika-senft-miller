        <p>My work seeks to encourage performers and audience members alike to look beyond the expected and embrace new perspectives. The site-specific nature of my projects breathes life to a creative process that informs every happening leading up to, during, and after a performance. Every participant—dancer, artist, performer, and viewer—becomes an active collaborator that shapes the meaning and execution of the work. Our experience is collectively built and shared. This website is no different. I’m inviting my collaborators, peers, and friends to contribute documentation of our work together; photos, videos, writing, and anything else you can dream are all welcome and will be added to the gallery of my projects.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your care, support, and participation. — ESM</p>
